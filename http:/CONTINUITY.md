- Goal (incl. success criteria):
  - Add manuscript-ready reporting outputs (tables, figure data, snippets) with a manuscript workflow, tests, docs, and updated artifacts; `pytest` passes.
- Constraints/Assumptions:
  - Follow Conway difference definition (PaCO2 − TcCO2) and authority hierarchy.
  - Do NOT modify `Code/Legacy/` or `Drafts/`; do NOT edit the Word manuscript.
  - Parameter uncertainty via route-1 study bootstrap; deterministic for fixed seed.
  - New Python code lives under `python/`; keep compute pure and I/O separate.
  - Add docstrings and comments explaining why calculations are defined.
  - End milestone with `pytest` run, artifacts updated, and provide git add/commit commands (do not run git).
- Key decisions:
  - Classification/two-stage intervals labeled as 95% CI (bootstrap percentile); parameter intervals labeled as 95% uncertainty interval; inference uses 95% PI.
- State:
  - Manuscript reporting code/tests/docs implemented; pytest passed and artifacts regenerated.
- Done:
  - Extended simulation metrics (LRs, misclassification, counts) and formatting.
  - Added `two_stage.py` and manuscript workflow module with tables/figure data/snippets.
  - Wired manuscript outputs into workflow scripts and added tests/docs.
  - Regenerated artifacts via `python scripts/rebuild_artifacts.py ...` and ran `pytest`.
- Now:
  - Summarize changes and provide git add/commit commands.
- Next:
  - User review and run git commands.
- Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
  - None.
